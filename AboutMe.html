    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Josh Delves, and I am from Ciudad Del Carmen, Mexico. After living in Houston, TX, for 12 years, I moved to Southeast Asia. I spent 3 years in Singapore and 2 years in Malaysia, where I graduated high school early. After finishing high school, I moved to Gunnison, Colorado, and did a year of college there before I decided that it wasn’t for me at the time. So I spent the next four years there working many jobs, such as landscaping, being a lift operator at a ski resort, and mixing concrete for high-quality sculptures and climbing walls. Hobbies I had while I lived in Colorado were snowboarding, skateboarding, and going on bike rides around the mountain trails. Now I’ve moved back to Houston, Texas, and am currently taking a coding bootcamp with Rice University, trying to advance myself and get a career in the tech field.
